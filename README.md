# üè¢ Real Estate Company Secure Network Infrastructure (Cisco Packet Tracer)

## üìå Objective
Design and implement a secure, scalable, and reliable network for a small real estate business with over 30 employees. The network supports seamless internal communication, guest access, remote work, and robust cybersecurity through segmentation, encryption, and proactive threat management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Features Implemented

### üîê **Security**
- **VLAN Segmentation** by department and function (Internal, Guest, Server)
- **Cisco ASA Firewall** for advanced perimeter defense
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** to control inter-VLAN and outbound traffic
- **AAA Authentication** using RADIUS with centralized login control
- **802.1X Wireless Authentication** with RADIUS for secure Wi-Fi
- **SSHv2 Remote Management** with session timeout & login tracking
- **Intrusion Detection & Prevention System (IDPS)**
- **Account Lockout, Password Policy & Logging** enforcement
- **Site-to-Site VPN (IPsec)** for secure remote office connectivity

### üì∂ **Connectivity & Routing**
- **Inter-VLAN Routing** with Layer 3 Switch
- **Dynamic Routing using OSPF**
- **Static & Default Routes** for internal and internet-bound traffic
- **Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)** with LWAPs (CAPWAP protocol)
- **Port Address Translation (PAT)** for internet access

### üîß **Switching & Optimization**
- **Rapid-PVST+**, **PortFast**, **BPDU Guard** for Layer 2 loop prevention
- **LACP / PAgP** EtherChannel for redundancy and performance
- **Port Security**, unused port shutdown, and black-hole VLANs
- **CDP/LLDP Disabled** on unused ports for security
- **Manual Speed/Duplex Configuration** on unused interfaces

### üì° **Infrastructure Services**
- **DHCP**, **DNS**, **NTP**, **SYSLOG**, **TFTP**
- **Web Server**, **Email Server**
- **Logging with Timestamps**, **Service Password Encryption**

### ‚òéÔ∏è **Voice over IP (VoIP)**
- **Dedicated Voice VLANs** for IP Phones
- **QoS Considerations** for optimal call quality
